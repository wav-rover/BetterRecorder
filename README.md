### Create polished, pro-grade screen recordings.
[Recordly](https://www.recordly.dev) is an **open-source screen recorder and editor** for creating **polished walkthroughs, demos, tutorials, and product videos**. Contribution encouraged.

> Note on origins: Recordly is a fork of the excellent [**OpenScreen**](https://github.com/siddharthvaddem/openscreen) foundation by [Siddharth](https://x.com/sidious_man), which is focused on robustness and a stable feature set. Recordly focuses on a different product direction - i.e. adding cursor animations, Apple-inspired zoom animations, smoother panning - and aims to reach full feature parity with Screen Studio.

## What is Recordly?

Recordly lets you record your screen and automatically transform it into a polished video. It handles the heavy lifting of zooming into important actions and smoothing out jittery cursor movement so your demos look professional by default.

Recordly runs on:

- **macOS**
- **Windows**
- **Linux**

macOS includes a **native smooth cursor animation pipeline**.  
Windows and Linux currently use Electron's capture path, which means the OS cursor cannot always be hidden during recording.

# Limitations

### Windows & Linux Cursor Capture

Electron’s desktop capture API does not allow hiding the system cursor during recording.

If you enable the animated cursor layer, recordings may contain **two cursors**.

Improving cross-platform cursor capture is an area where contributions are welcome.

---

### System Audio

System audio capture depends on platform support.

**Windows**
- Works out of the box

**Linux**
- Requires PipeWire (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 34+)
- Older PulseAudio setups may not support system audio

**macOS**
- Requires macOS 12.3+
- Uses ScreenCaptureKit helper

---

# How It Works

Recordly is a **desktop video editor with a renderer-driven motion pipeline and platform-specific capture layer**.

**Capture**
- Electron orchestrates recording
- macOS uses native helpers for ScreenCaptureKit and cursor telemetry

**Motion**
- Zoom regions
- Cursor tracking
- Speed changes
- Timeline edits

**Rendering**
- Scene composition handled by **PixiJS**

**Export**
- Frames rendered through the same scene pipeline
- Encoded to MP4 or GIF

**Projects**
- `.recordly` files store the source video path and editor state

---

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

Please:

- Keep pull requests **focused and modular**
